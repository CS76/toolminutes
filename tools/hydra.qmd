# Hydra 

## Getting started

Hydra is an open-source Python framework that simplifies the development of research and other complex applications. The key feature is the ability to dynamically create a hierarchical configuration by composition and override it through config files and the command line. The name Hydra comes from its ability to run multiple similar jobs - much like a Hydra with multiple heads.


### Key features:

* Hierarchical configuration composable from multiple sources
* Configuration can be specified or overridden from the command line
* Dynamic command line tab completion
* Run your application locally or launch it to run remotely
* Run multiple jobs with different arguments with a single command


### Installation

```commandline
pip install hydra-core --upgrade
```


### Basic example

Config, e.g., in `conf/config.yaml`: 

```yaml
db:
driver: mysql
user: omry
pass: secret
```
