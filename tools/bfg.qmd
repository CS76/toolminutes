# BFG Repo-Cleaner

If you did not take with your `.gitignore` or just used `git add .` you might have by accident committed large files. 
This might lead to an error like 

```
remote: error: See https://gh.io/lfs for more information.
remote: error: File reports/gemini-pro/.langchain.db is 123.01 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB
remote: error: GH001: Large files detected. You may want to try Git Large File Storage - https://git-lfs.github.com.
To github.com:lamalab-org/chem-bench.git
 ! [remote rejected]     kjappelbaum/issue258 -> kjappelbaum/issue258 (pre-receive hook declined)
error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:lamalab-org/chem-bench.git'
```

To fix this, you need to remove the large files. A convenient tool for doing this is [BFG](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/).

Once you download the file you can run it using something like

```
java -jar ~/Downloads/bfg-1.14.0.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 100M --no-blob-protection
```

to remove large files. 

Note that this here uses `--no-blob-protection` as BFG defaults to not touching the last commit. 

After the BFG run, it will prompt you to run something like 

```
git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```
