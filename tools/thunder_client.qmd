# Thunder Client 

[Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.com/) is a lightweight alternative to [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) that can be used directly from VSCode. 

You can use it to test your API endpoints.

For an example, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/AbCTlemwZ1k?si=1r6A5OBaqk_GiwO).


## Installation

Install the [Thunder client extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client) from the marketplace.
